                <p>It's helpful to know that <em>everything on a webpage is inside of a box</em>. What do I mean by
                    this? Well, for example, this text is inside a box that I created called "Article", which is inside
                    a box labeled "Article Container", which is inside a box labeled "Webpage Container" which is inside
                    a box labeled "Body". Are you confused yet? Because that would be normal, but we'll round this point
                    out, I promise. I'm just going to use some non-traditional terminology to help you get there with
                    me!</p>
                <p>To help us get there together, I want you to imagine that you're building a house. In order to build
                    that house, we'll need a builder, a painter, and an electrician. The builder frames out the house,
                    the painter makes it look fun and interesting, and the electrician makes sure that when you flip the
                    light switch, the light comes on!</p>

                <h2 class="articleTitle">Hayden (HTML)</h2>
                <p>Congratulations, you hired your first employee! Their name is Hayden! Hayden is the best framer you
                    could have hired, you just have to tell them what to do and they'll do it!</p>
                <p>Hayden loves to build walls to make sure everything is compartmentalized perfectly inside the house.
                    He prefers to call walls "Dividers" though, or even better "divs" and to help Chris, he likes to
                    name those walls using classes!</p>
                <p>What room do you want Hayden to build first? The <strong>kitchen, living room, bathroom, </strong> or
                    <strong> bedroom?</strong></p>
                <input type="text" id="roomInput" placeholder="Enter room name">

        <p>Not quite what you expected that to look like?</p>
        <div class="articleText">
            <p>That's normal! Remember, these are just the bones of the house. Houses don't make a lot of sense visually
                when they're just framework.</p>
            <p>That being said, take a minute to look those rooms over! Notice how everything we could possibly want
                inside the room is divided up into boxes that contain other boxes? For example, the knife is inside a
                box labeled cutting board, the cuttingboard is inside a box labeled counters, counters are inside a box
                labeled counterspace, counterspace is inside a box labeled floor, floor is inside a box labeled walls,
                and walls are inside a box labeled kitchen.</p>
            <p>But something's wrong! Until things are colored and given properties, none of these boxes mean anything
                at all!</p>
            <p>Hayden makes great dividers, but without Chris, all of these things are just being stacked directly on
                top of each other.</p>
            <p>Hayden, like all good builders, can technically paint and design the space, but that's not their job, so
                it's better to pass this part of the job off to Chris!</p>

                <p>Now that you've built our house, we need to make it presentable! Chris is here to help! This is where
                    things can get a bit finicky, so we'll start at the ground level.</p>
                <p>First and foremost, we need to understand the language used to describe different parts of one box.
                </p>
                <p>There are technically four parts to every box that Hayden builds for us.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Content</li>
                    <li>Padding</li>

                <p>This particular box is carrying our great great great grandmas very expensive, very fragile bust. The
                    bust, in this case, is our content!
                <p>If you were putting this box in a moving truck that is going to drive like a maniac through Colorado
                    mountains, how would you make sure the bust doesn't get broken?</p>

            <div class="article">
                <p>Okay! Now that we've talked about padding, let's talk about margin! Padding and margin are going to be your two most useful tools when it comes to arranging things, but I'll admit. Even I sometimes get confused about which one to manipulate to make things work right!</p>
                <p>Padding is the area inside a box, and margin is the area outside of a box. Margin, because it's usually unseen, is more like a forcefield around something that keeps other things at a distance that you decide.</p>
                <p>Let's look at great great great grandmas very expensive bust again, but this time we're fortunate enough to have two!</p>
